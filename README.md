# Classifying-Clinically-Actionable-Genetic-Mutations
### Predict the effect of Genetic Variants to enable Personalized Medicine

A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.

Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 

Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations.

We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
